# gold_medal_table
Code repository behind a submission for the 2020 RStudio Table Contest by Tyler Sanders with Red Oak Strategic. 

This repository contains the following: 

Code: 
- olympics.Rmd: An RMarkdown document that contains the code for building my submission table, in addition to the code samples used in my table tutorial. 
- a series of .PNG images for the final table (gold.png, silver.png, bronze.png, and olympic.png)

Data:
- dictionary.csv: file with dataset documentation
- summer.csv: summer olympic medal data, used in tutorial and final table creation 
- winter.csv: winter olympic medal data in the same form as summer.csv. Great data for trying to build your own award winning table with!

Outputs: 
- olympics.html: A sample output of the final table in .html format
